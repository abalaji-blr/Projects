# Geometry

Geometry concerns with properties of **space** that are related with *distance, shape, size and relative position of figures*.

**Euclid** introduced certain axioms / assumptions / postulates ([Eculid postulates](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/EuclidsPostulates.html)) to express the properties of  *points, lines and planes*. You can express any dimensional objects (2D - planes, 3D- space, etc). 

Later, to represent the points - coordinate system was introduced. That's called as **Cartesian Coordinate** system. 

For example for 2D objects, you need ordered pair (x1, y1) to represent a point. For 3D objects, we need 3-tuple to represent a point in a space.

Note that, the **Eculidean geometry** (Euclid plane or Euclid space ( 3D or more) ), deals with **planar** surface. That's no **curved** surfaces. This is made sure using Euclid's **Postulate 5** aka **parallel postulate**. That is, if we take a point in a plane / space, then there can be **only one parallel line** drawn to each **axis**.

In the case of **Curved surfaces**, there can be **either zero or more than one** parallel lines can be drawn. Thus, they are called **Non-Euclidean geometry**.
