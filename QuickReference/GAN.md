# Generative Modeling & Generative Adverserial Networks (GAN)

1. **What is Generative Modeling?**

Given a set of training samples, the model can form / identify  the probability distribution, which explains where the training examples came from.

The Generative modeling can be used in the following ways:

 * Density estimation

   From the samples, Identify the probability density estimation.

 * Sample Generation.

   From the samples, learn the probablity distribution and generate the sample using the distribution.

   GAN comes under this category.



2. **Why Generative Models are important?**

   * Ability to use compilcated probability distribution.

   * Used to simulate possible scenarios in the case of Reinforced learning.

   * Fill the missing data.

   * Realistic generation tasks. ( super ressolution of images)

   * Multi modal outputs

     * one test sample can be mapped to multiple outputs.
     * Image to Image translation. Turning sketches to images.

     

3. How do **generative models** work?

   * Maximum Likelihood Probablity Distribution
     * Explicit Density Function
       * Tractable Density
       * Approximate Density
         * Variational (Varitonal Autoencoders)
         * Markov Chain (Boltzmann Machine)
     * Implicit Density Function
       * Markov Chain (GSN - Generative Sotchastic Network)
       * Direct sampling (GAN - Generative Sampling Network)

4. How do GAN's work?

   [AI wiki | GAN Blog](<https://skymind.ai/wiki/generative-adversarial-network-gan>)

   * There are two different models (networks) which are adversaries to each other.

     * Generator
       * They generate the samples which are intended to be in the *training distribution*.
     * Discriminator
       * Need to train this model using the training samples.
       * Also, it examines the *generated samples* (from generator) with the training set and classify whether the sample is *fake or real*.

5. What are *Autoencoders*?

   Autoencoders are family of neural networks for which the input is same as the output. They work by **compressing** the input into a **latent-space representation**, and then reconstructing the output from this representation.

   It is a pair of two connected networks, an encoder and a decoder.

6. What are Variational Autoencoders?

   The Variational Autoencoders also have two connected networks, an encoder and a decoder.

   They have a property that the **latent space** generated by encoder by design is **continuous**.

   Thus allows easy random sampling. **They achieve by not just storing the encoding vector of size n,**

   **instead they store - a vector of means, $\mu$  and a vector of variance, $\sigmaâ€‹$. **
