# Image Application

## What are the image applications?

1) Image Classification (using CNN)
2) Object Detection
    * RCNN (Region CNN)
3) Neural Style Transfer
    * Given a source and style images, generate  a destination image by transferring the style from style image to source image.
4) GAN ( Generative Adverserial Network):
    * Generate the fake image which is very close to authentic image.
5) Super Resoultion CNN (SRCNN):
    * Given a low resolution image, generate the higher resolution picture.
